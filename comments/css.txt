below will be the comments for css


####### FONTS #####

px -- is the most commonly used unit
but not recommended for responsive website as it will be changing

font-size to change the size of the font

changing font, fonts should be installed in the browser
safe to use the browser fonts
https://www.cssfontstack.com/ check the link for commonly used fonts
you can add many fonts as choices one after another by adding a comma

text transform to uppercase/lowecase/capitalize in css

use mark{} in css to change the color of the marker

HELLO THERE
how are you doing???


testing git push for the second time

###### CSS SELECTOR #########
Universal Selector - * - this selects everything in the document
example
*{
    color:black;
} -  this makes everything black

button - this selects all buttons
example
button{
    font-size: 18px;
}

we can use comma to use multiple selectors 
like 
h1,h2{
    font-size: violet;
}


###### ID Selector #######
we can use id to hook between html and css
but when using an id of a html in css, you have to add #in front of the id in css
no space between # and the id text in css
1 id should be only used once when for the hook
use id selectors as less as possible, there are other selectors to style individual elements

##### Class Selector #######
same as an id selector(check above) but this can be use on multiple elements
when using class hook in css, you have to add a . in front of the class name in css
by using class we can group together different elements to style them in css

###### Decendant Selector #########
we write using a space
decendants - like we have in list, one inside another 

####### Adjacent selector ######
we write using +
adding two selectors **(one selector which is right inside another)** to style
but only the second selector will be styled 
example 
h1 + P {
    color:red;
}
above, h1 is a selector and p is another selector and we add them by putting + inbetween

###### Direct Child #####
selects only the li that are directly inside a div
example
div > li{
    color:white;
}

#### Attribute Selector ####
select an input element where the type attribute is set to "text"
example
input[type="text"]{
    width: 300px;
    color: yellow;
}

class of post
section[class="post"]{
    color:blue;
}

href matching
a[href="www.google.com"]{
    color=blue;
}

href containing
a[href*="example"]{
    font-size*=2px;
}

href ending
a[href$=".org"]{
    font-style:italic;
}

######## Pseudo Class ######
keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s)
:active - currently on active( style when the element press and hold)
:checked - radio button or checkboxes
:first
:first-child
:hover - style when the cursor is hovering on the element
:not()
:nth-child()
:nth-of-type(3) - style the 3rd element
:nth-of-type(3n) - style every 3rd element

they all start with a collon
