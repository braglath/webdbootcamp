####### FONTS #####

px -- is the most commonly used unit
but not recommended for responsive website as it will be changing

font-size to change the size of the font

changing font, fonts should be installed in the browser
safe to use the browser fonts
https://www.cssfontstack.com/ check the link for commonly used fonts
you can add many fonts as choices one after another by adding a comma

text transform to uppercase/lowecase/capitalize in css

use mark{} in css to change the color of the marker

HELLO THERE
how are you doing???


testing git push for the second time

###### CSS SELECTOR #########
Universal Selector - * - this selects everything in the document
example
*{
    color:black;
} -  this makes everything black

button - this selects all buttons
example
button{
    font-size: 18px;
}

we can use comma to use multiple selectors 
like 
h1,h2{
    font-size: violet;
}


###### ID Selector #######
we can use id to hook between html and css
but when using an id of a html in css, you have to add #in front of the id in css
no space between # and the id text in css
1 id should be only used once when for the hook
use id selectors as less as possible, there are other selectors to style individual elements

##### Class Selector #######
same as an id selector(check above) but this can be use on multiple elements
when using class hook in css, you have to add a . in front of the class name in css
by using class we can group together different elements to style them in css
