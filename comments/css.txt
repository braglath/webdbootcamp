###### CSS SELECTOR #########
Universal Selector - * - this selects everything in the document
example
*{
    color:black;
} -  this makes everything black

button - this selects all buttons
example
button{
    font-size: 18px;
}

we can use comma to use multiple selectors 
like 
h1,h2{
    font-size: violet;
}
