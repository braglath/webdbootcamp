below will be the comments for css


####### FONTS #####

px -- is the most commonly used unit
but not recommended for responsive website as it will be changing

font-size to change the size of the font

changing font, fonts should be installed in the browser
safe to use the browser fonts
https://www.cssfontstack.com/ check the link for commonly used fonts
you can add many fonts as choices one after another by adding a comma

text transform to uppercase/lowecase/capitalize in css

use mark{} in css to change the color of the marker

HELLO THERE
how are you doing???


testing git push for the second time

###### CSS SELECTOR #########
Universal Selector - * - this selects everything in the document
example
*{
    color:black;
} -  this makes everything black

button - this selects all buttons
example
button{
    font-size: 18px;
}

we can use comma to use multiple selectors 
like 
h1,h2{
    font-size: violet;
}


###### ID Selector #######
we can use id to hook between html and css
but when using an id of a html in css, you have to add #in front of the id in css
no space between # and the id text in css
1 id should be only used once when for the hook
use id selectors as less as possible, there are other selectors to style individual elements

##### Class Selector #######
same as an id selector(check above) but this can be use on multiple elements
when using class hook in css, you have to add a . in front of the class name in css
by using class we can group together different elements to style them in css

###### Decendant Selector #########
we write using a space
decendants - like we have in list, one inside another 

####### Adjacent selector ######
we write using +
adding two selectors **(one selector which is right inside another)** to style
but only the second selector will be styled 
example 
h1 + P {
    color:red;
}
above, h1 is a selector and p is another selector and we add them by putting + inbetween

###### Direct Child #####
selects only the li that are directly inside a div
example
div > li{
    color:white;
}

#### Attribute Selector ####
select an input element where the type attribute is set to "text"
example
input[type="text"]{
    width: 300px;
    color: yellow;
}

class of post
section[class="post"]{
    color:blue;
}

href matching
a[href="www.google.com"]{
    color=blue;
}

href containing
a[href*="example"]{
    font-size*=2px;
}

href ending
a[href$=".org"]{
    font-style:italic;
}

######## Pseudo Class ######
they all start with a collon
keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s)
:active - currently on active( style when the element press and hold)
:checked - radio button or checkboxes
:first
:first-child
:hover - style when the cursor is hovering on the element
:not()
:nth-child()
:nth-of-type(3) - style the 3rd element
:nth-of-type(3n) - style every 3rd element


###### Pseudo Elements ########
they all start with ::
keyword added to a selector that lets you style a particular part of selected element(s)
::after - add stylized text at the end of a line, not only text we can also have special charcs, icons, url and more
z::first-letter - stylize the first letter of an element
::selection - when a user selects something on the page, you can stylize the color and more 

###### The CSS Cascade #######
the order your styles are declared and linked matters!!!!!!!!
whatever style comes the second wins
example
h1{
    color:blue;
}
h2{
    color:purple;
}
from the above style, only the purple color will be shown!!!!!
this also matters even when we use more than one style sheet
the order we link the css in main html file also matters. whatever comes second will be shown
overrides the first style

###### Specificity #######
it is how the browser decides which rules to apply when multiple rules could apply to the same element
it is a measure of how specific a given selector is. The more specific selector "wins" 
oder of Specificity
ID, Class, Element
we can use "specifitycalculator.com"

if you add "!important" at the end of any style then it wins \
generally try not to use important as it only overrides and it is not the right way

inline styles - styling a element inside of css in the same line
generally avoid inline style as it makes more confusing

##### Inheritance #######
elements will get the style even if it is not directly applied
example
HTML
<body>
<h1>sdfsdfsdsd</h1>
</body> 

CSS
body{
    color:blue;
}

certain elements don't inherit styles by default 
all texts will inherit

workaround to inherit a color 
button{
    color: inherit;
}

######### Box ##########
width - width of the entire box, this alters the contents inside the box
height - height of the entire box, this alters the contents inside the box
border-width - thickness of the border
border-color - color of the border
border-style - line style , dashed, solid and more

##### Padding ###
same as above we can add padding to individual sides
examples of usages
padding: 10px; - put padding on all 4 sides
padding: 5px 10px; - padding on verical and horizontal sides
padding: 1px 3px 2px; - top | horizontal | bottom
padding: 5px 1px 0 3px; - top | right | bottom | left
