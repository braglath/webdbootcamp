we can also have a footer to an article

copyright information, logos and search forms unless the search form is the main content of the page.

<thead> - header of a table, put the first row inside header, we can add more then one header
<tbody> - put the body of the table here
<tfoot> - last row of the table, only if there is any conclusion like total of numbers
rowspan - inside <th> = <th rowspan = "2"> - takes up 2 boxes
colspan - inside <th> = <th colspan = "2"> - takes 2 categories
